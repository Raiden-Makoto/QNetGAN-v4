# QNetGAN-V4
> Hybrid Quantum-Classical Graph Generative Adversarial Network for synthesizing molecules (4th version of QNetGAN).

### Dataset
Trained on the QM9 dataset, which contains approximately 134000 small organic molecules (only H, C, N, O, F atoms) along with properties such as `homo` (highest occupied molecular orbital), `lumo` (lowest occupied molecular orbital), `zpve` (zero point vibrational energy), etc.

Uses **Variational Quantum Circuits** to encode molecular adjacency matrices and molecule features into the latent space for richer expressivity.

### Model Architecture
No clue
